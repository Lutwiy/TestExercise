Task 1.

In our system, many users are trying to access.
Each user is assigned a Token by an external identification service.
Our task is to process this token and display an error message according to the business rule.

The business requires:
* For each user whose token is divisible by 7 without a remainder, display 'Temporary Ban' next to their token.
* If the token is divisible by 3 without a remainder, display 'Had Warnings'.
* If the token is divisible by both 3 and 7 without a remainder, display 'Permanent Banned'.
* Users whose token is not divisible by any of these numbers should not be displayed.
