Task 2.

The business liked your solution for the previous task.
Now, a new system is being integrated, and it requires a similar authorization logic but with other rules.

The business wants the same logic to apply to the numbers 4 and 5:
* For numbers divisible by 4, display the message 'Temporary Ban'.
* For numbers divisible by 5, display the message 'Had Warnings'.
* For numbers divisible by both 4 and 5, display 'Permanent Banned'.
* The logic for 7 and 3 must remain unchanged.

For example, for the token 12, the console should display:

Token 12 - 'Had Warnings'. User - Abigail Alexander.  
Token 12 - 'Temporary Ban'. User - Abigail Alexander.
